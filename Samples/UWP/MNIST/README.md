# MNIST sample

This simple UWP application uses MNIST, a trained machine learning model, to recognize a numeric digit drawn by the user.

For step-by-step instructions on how to create this sample, see the [Get Started with Windows ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/machine-learning/get-started) tutorial.

## Requirements

- [Windows 10 - Build 17110 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso)
- [Windows SDK - Build 17110 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK)

## Build the sample
