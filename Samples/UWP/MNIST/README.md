# MNIST Sample

A simple UWP application that uses a trained machine learning model (MNIST) to recognize a numeric digit drawn by the user.

This sample demonstrates the use of Visual Studio ML generation to easily create a model interface for your application.
Once you have a pre-trained ONNX model, you can add the model file directly to your application to automicatlly generate the model representation, and the model inputs and outputs.
