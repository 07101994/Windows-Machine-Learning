# MNIST Sample

A simple UWP application that uses a trained machine learning model (MNIST) to recognize a numeric digit drawn by the user.

This sample demonstrates the use of Visual Studio ML generation to easily create a model interface for your application.
Once you have a pre-trained ONNX model, you can add the model file directly to your application to automicatlly generate the model representation, and the model inputs and outputs. 

For step-by-step instructions on how to create this sample, go to: [Windows Machine Learning - Get Started](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/uwp/machine-learning/get-started).



## Build the sample


1. If you download the samples ZIP, be sure to unzip the entire archive, not just the folder with
   the sample you want to build.

2. Start Microsoft Visual Studio 2017 and select **File** \> **Open** \> **Project/Solution**.

3. Starting in the folder where you unzipped the samples, go to the Samples subfolder, then the
   subfolder for this specific sample, then the subfolder for your preferred language (C++, C#, or
   JavaScript). Double-click the Visual Studio Solution (.sln) file.

4. Press Ctrl+Shift+B, or select **Build** \> **Build Solution**.



## Run the sample



The next steps depend on whether you just want to deploy the sample or you want to both deploy and
run it.



### Deploying the sample

- Select Build > Deploy Solution. 



### Deploying and running the sample

- To debug the sample and then run it, press F5 or select Debug >  Start Debugging. To run the sample without debugging, press Ctrl+F5 or selectDebug > Start Without Debugging.
