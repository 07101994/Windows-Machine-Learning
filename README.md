# Windows ML samples

This repo contains sample apps that demonstrate how to use Windows ML to build machine learning applications for Windows 10.

For tutorials, how-tos, and additional information, see the [Windows ML documentation](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai/?branch=master):

## Pre-release APIs

These samples use the [Windows.AI.MachineLearning APIs](https://docs.microsoft.com/uwp/api/windows.ai.machinelearning), a pre-released product which may be substantially modified before itâ€™s commercially released. Microsoft makes no warranties, express or implied, with respect to the information provided here.

## Sample apps

These generic examples show how to use various models and input feeds with Windows ML. We have both C++ native apps and C# UWP samples

- **FNSCandyStyleTransfer\UWP\cs**: a UWP C# app that uses the FNS-Candy style transfer model to make a cool image.
- **SqueezeNetObjectDetection\UWP\cs**: a UWP C# app that uses the SqueezeNet model to detect the predominant object in an image.
- **SqueezeNetObjectDetection\Desktop\cpp**: a classic desktop C++ app that usesthe SqueezeNet model to detect the predominant object in an image.
- **MNIST\UWP\cs**: a UWP C# app that uses the MNIST model to detect numberic characters.
- **MNIST\UWP\cx**: a UWP C++/CX app that uses the MNIST model to detect numberic characters.

## Requirements

- [Windows 10 - Build 17713 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso)
- [Windows SDK - Build 17713 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK)
