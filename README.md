# Windows ML samples

This repo contains sample apps that demonstrate how to use Windows ML to build machine learning applications for Windows 10.

We also have additional information and resources available here:
https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/uwp/machine-learning

## Sample apps

- **MNIST**: Uses the MNIST model to recognize a numeric digit drawn by the user.
- **SqueezeNet**: Uses the SqueezeNet model to detect the predominant object in an image.
- **WinMLExplorer**: Uses a circuit board defect detection model to detect defects from images or a real-time camera feed.

## Requirements

- [Windows 10 - Build 17110 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewiso)
- [Windows SDK - Build 17110 or higher](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windowsinsiderpreviewSDK)
